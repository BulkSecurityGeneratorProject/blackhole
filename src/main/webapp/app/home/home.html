            <h1 translate="home.title">Welcome to the Blackhole</h1>
	           <p>With two goals in mind, I started Blackhole to learn AngularJS and the modern-side of web development. And, I needed an application to keep records for my consulting business.
               I chose to name my application Blackhole. Blackholes eat everything in their proximity. That is what I want. I want the application to be easy
               to use and just eat my data. I want the process of data entry to be as painless and mindless as possible. I imagine being sucked into a blackhole quickly and painlessly.</p>
             <p>I wrestled with my choice of data capture and what service the application would provide. The application will accept my data and keep (persist) it in a relational database for
               later analysis. Also, the application will provide real-time viewing of the data I have entered. I decided to focus on financial things (accounting). That is important to any business. And, I am
               not going to pay for an electronic accountant in a green box. My wife is an accountant and I don't believe accountants should be required to know a particular accounting software
               product. If your education or experience is not sufficient to operate the corporate accounting system, then I truly believe the system or software is a failure. Forcing the craft of a
               professional in the direction of commercial software products is WRONG!<p>
             <p>I have also created the ability to capture entrepreneurial ideas, work leads, and contacts. I will probably add more entities and features as I use this application. I have spent my career
               working on applications that I personally do not use. This will be different. Blackhole was written for me but you can download the source at the Github link below. It may suit your needs
               as an entrepreneur or independent consultant too.</p>
