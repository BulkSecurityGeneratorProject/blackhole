The favicon comes free from http://www.freefavicon.com/ and it's called Vine. I've downloaded a zip file
and that zip may contain other images that could be used if I start a Blackhole organization for multiple
open-source or public repos. Again it's called Vine and it could the signature Blackhole icon.
